# Puncha App

**Ayubowan! üôè**

Welcome to **Puncha**, my very first web app, developed as part of my journey to learn DevOps. üéâ  
The code is simple and mostly written with the help of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot‚Äîlearning as I go!

## About Puncha

Puncha is designed for everyone who loves puns! Whether you want to:  
- **Read** and enjoy a collection of puns.  
- **Vote** on your favorite puns.  
- **Contribute** by adding your own puns to the library.  

This app is all about celebrating the humor and creativity of wordplay.

## Current Status

This is a work in progress. So far, it includes:
- Basic app functionality to display puns.

Next steps include:
- A retro-style front-end design inspired by old video games.
- Adding a voting system.  
- Allowing users to submit their own puns.  
- Setting up automation and CI/CD pipelines.

## Why Puncha?

This app is part of my DevOps learning journey. It‚Äôs helping me explore:
- Web development basics (Python, Flask, SQLite).  
- Version control with Git and GitHub.  
- Deployment and DevOps tools.

## Contributing

This is just the beginning! Feel free to explore the code and share your thoughts or suggestions via [GitHub Issues](#).
